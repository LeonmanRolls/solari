This property has also been a tearoom, pottery studio, surf-shop and cafe. The previous owners

gutted, while the living areas were very dated with a layout that didn't work well for a family home.

design options, which got us really excited about what was possible to achieve. When together we
found the coloured Rodeca we used for the front facade, we knew we had the potential to make a
real statement of the outside of this amazing building. The front of the house now is one of our

building, and there wasn't a single straight line in the entire place. The exterior cladding, which was
supposed to be a quick installation, ended up taking almost six months to complete, with an
entirely new framework needing to be built to provide a straight and stable base. It massively
increased our budget, and was a very real stress at the time; but looking at it now we know there
was no real alternative. The anodised aluminium and Rodeca gave us amazing protection from the
sand, wind and salt which is the cost of living on the beautiful rugged South Coast."]

lot! James was really open to us choosing his level of involvement - we already had a lot of ideas of
what we wanted to achieve, and some areas where we wanted to be in control of the design. He
was happy to offer advice on these areas, and then take charge the areas where we needed more
technical expertise. We also relied heavily on his years of experience in navigating the council

from other architects is that he’s easy to work with. He’s open minded, down to earth and when it
comes to discussing plans and layouts and he isn’t too precious – there’s no ego. He is also very
good at listening and coming up with creative solutions. He gets the grasp of what you're saying,
takes it on board and works with it."]

designing this and has not only delivered a design that fits the brief but a project that meets the
budget – something that is usually very difficult to achieve. I put this down to the fact that James
takes into account potential bill costs when designing your project and always finds a balance
between look, style and budget. He is always thinking about maximising the return on your
investment, which is an asset in itself."]

the WCC and working through consent issues. He understands your project fully and is able to bat
for you."]

really good feedback. How a project flows is a critical part of the resource consent process and
James and Co maximise the use of a space and ensure it's efficient. An efficient floor plan layout is
critical and James’ experience working with large projects overseas really shows in this area. James
is also very good at sorting out issues on sight as they arise. He is intuitive and quick to respond so

builders aren’t fans of architects but James is respected by and has a good rapport with
contractors on site. So much so that he runs/chairs the fortnightly site meetings - which all comes
down to good communication. Nobody likes working with an ego."]

great value for money and have absolutely exceeded my expectations. Having worked with James
previously I knew what I was getting myself into with this project and it's fantastic to see he works
to the same standard as always. Without hesitation I would recommend getting Solari Architects
